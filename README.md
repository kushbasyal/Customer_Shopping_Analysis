# Customer Shopping Data Analysis and Dashboard Project

## Overview

This project performs end-to-end data analysis and visualization of customer shopping data. The workflow covers:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python
- Statistical and time series analysis
- Data visualization for exploratory insights
- Saving the cleaned dataset
- Loading the cleaned data into MySQL
- Executing SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis
- Creating interactive dashboards in Power BI for business insights

---

## Workflow Details

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Python)

- Load raw customer shopping data into Python (e.g., pandas DataFrame)
- Check and handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal)
- Fix and convert data types to appropriate formats (e.g., date, numeric, categorical)
- Detect and remove duplicate records
- Perform any necessary data transformations and feature engineering

### 2. Statistical Analysis and Grouping

- Generate summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Group data by relevant categories (e.g., shopping centers, customer segments)
- Perform time series analysis on transaction dates to identify trends and seasonality

### 3. Data Visualization

- Visualize data distributions and relationships using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Plot time series trends, bar charts, and other relevant visualizations to support insights

### 4. Save Cleaned Dataset

- Export the cleaned and processed dataset to CSV or another suitable format for database import

### 5. Load Data into MySQL

- Import the cleaned dataset into a MySQL database for efficient querying
- Create necessary tables and define primary keys and indexes for performance

### 6. Data Retrieval Using SQL

- Write and execute SQL queries to retrieve and analyze key business metrics
- Examples include total sales, customer counts, top products, and trend analysis

### 7. Power BI Dashboard Creation

- Connect Power BI to the MySQL database
- Build interactive reports and dashboards visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Use slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration
- Publish and share dashboards for stakeholders

## How to Run

1. Run the Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks to clean and analyze the data.
2. Export the cleaned data as CSV.
3. Import the CSV into MySQL using tools like MySQL Workbench or command line.
4. Use provided SQL scripts to query data.
5. Connect Power BI Desktop to the MySQL database.
6. Create and customize dashboards based on business needs.
